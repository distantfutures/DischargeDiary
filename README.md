# DischargeDiary
An app that allows a user to record & track their daily discharges/bowel movements.

## How It Works
On the main page, displays a list of discharges, if any, and the user specifies the type of discharge they'd like to record by pressing #1 or #2. The user then answers a short series of questions through button presses related to the type of discharge and submits the data to be recorded. The recorded data then shows up on the main page to display the attributes of the discharge simply and clearly. Should they recognize a pattern, they can refer to the app for future discussions with their doctor.
